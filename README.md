# Password-Generator
Modifying Code for a password generator. A function was missing to generate a desired password. We had to write the function to generate the password and which had to satisfy certain criteria. Confirm messages were used to make the user decide on the use of different input types (these were uppercase & lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters). Variables were created from arrays of the different possible inputs. If the user confirmed the use of an input type, then that input type's array was then added to one main array named userGuess. A prompt message is then used to convey that the password needed to be at least 8 characters in length and no more than 128 characters. When the user enters a number between those values, a For loop runs that creates a randomized index selection from the main array named userGuess. And continues to run until the generated password is a length of the number the user entered into the prompt box.
